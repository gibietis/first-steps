First steps in programming. From a beginner, to wherever this leads me in the future.

Today is July 20th, 2022, 22:32 PM UTC-3.

This marks the beginning of my journey into programming. Until now, I've have some basic experience in some courses, but nothing that motivated me a lot. I was watching a video on carreers as a programmer, unrelated to my experience with courses, and suddenly this guy just gives the anser to the question I've been making for during these last few weeks.

"What course should I take to really learn programming?" That was my question. And the truth is, for a self-taught individual, courses really don't make much of a difference. I mean, he had a great point. He said that all courses look the same and will teach you really basic stuff. But how do I know that the course programme is basic, if I don't know what truly is basic or advanced into programming?

Well, I've thought for a few seconds and recalled being able to learn English and French, as well as the entire Adobe Creative Cloude suit by myself, without a single course (well, at least without completing one, or finding one decent). I've compared what Photoshop courses offered, and if I would benefit from them today. I wouldn't. Maybe they'd have made my life easier in the beginnging, but no way the would've taught me anything great. Everything came from wanting to learn and re-create techniques that amazed me.

In this regard, I've decided to take things into my own hands. I'll start coding the same way I've learned these things in the past: by practice.

This just-created GitHub will track my evolution and my learning process.

That's all for now.

Vents.
