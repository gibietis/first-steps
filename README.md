# Helo there!

Thanks for stopping by and checking out first-steps. This is where I'll upload my code.

Initially, I was thinking of uploading different stuff, with well-structured codes. Yet, I've seen (and heard people talking about) the relevance of sharing even the most basic exercises on my porfolio. With that in mind, I've decided to upload exercises and simple code, too.

I'm currently focusing in:

* Python programming
* Machine learning
* Data analysis/science
* Applied mathematics
