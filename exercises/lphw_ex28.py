#Okay, so we're supposed to work a little bit with boolean operators. We should assign true of false to each line and check if it's correct.

True and True #true
False and True #false
1 == 1 and 2 == 1 #false
"test" == "test" #true
1 == 1 or 2 != 1 #true
True and 1 == 1 #true
False and 0 != 0 #false
True or 1 == 1 #true
"test" == "testing" #false
1 != 0 and 2 == 1 #false
"test" != "testing" #true
"test" == 1 #false
not (True and False) #True
not (1 == 1 and 0 != 1) #false
not (10 == 1 or 1000 == 1000) #false
not (1 != 10 or 3 == 4) #true - I got this one wrong, it's false. I haven't read it with the due attention the first time.
not ("testing" == "testing" and "Zed" == "Cool Guy") #true
1 == 1 and (not ("testing" == 1 or 1 == 0)) #true
"chunky" == "bacon" and (not (3 == 4 or 3 == 3)) #false
3 == 3 and (not ("testing" == "testing" or "Python" == "Fun")) #false
#usually getting easier ones wrong and getting the harder ones right mean you didn't pay enough attention to the exercise (probably because you thought it was too easy)
