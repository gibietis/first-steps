#This is exercise 40 along with the drills proposed by Zed. OOP is pretty challenging at first sight, being very honest.
#I still can't understand much of it.
#Drill one is to add some songs and comprehend that you're actually using a list of strings as the lyrics. The comma at the end of
#each string actually helped me to make this more clear in my head.

#Drill two is to add the lyrics in a separate variable, the pass this variable to the class.
#One observation: I bought the regular version of the book in portuguese. Good old printed book. Yet, they wanted to translate
#absolutely everything written, and it didn't work well in some cases. Once in a while I refer to the english version in PDF to understand something.

#For drill three, the task is to add something, even if you don't know what and how or just break the code
#I've checked a website called "Stacey Learns Code" and found a nice idea for this drill,
#which is to print the song artist. The code is in Python 3.X, looks very different and I wasn't able to replicate it for now.

#PS:
#Okay, the code wasn't in Python, it was in Ruby. It seems that exercise 40 in both books is the same, even the drills are equal.
